# Resume Screening & Skill Extraction AI (Flask Edition)

An advanced AI-powered platform designed to streamline recruitment by automatically screening resumes and extracting key technical and soft skills using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and NER (Named Entity Recognition).

## 🚀 Features
- **Intelligent Screening**: Ranks candidates against a Job Description using a custom-built, lightweight TF-IDF Cosine Similarity and Keyword Matching algorithm.
- **Skill Extraction**: Automatically identifies and categorizes technical skills, soft skills, and tool proficiencies.
- **Dual Format Support**: Processes both PDF and DOCX resumes seamlessly.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Premium glassmorphism UI with real-time filtering, match scoring visualizations, and candidate comparisons.
- **Custom Catalogs**: Support for custom skills catalogs via XLSX for industry-specific tailoring.

    A[Upload Resumes PDF/DOCX] --> B[Text Parser];
    C[Upload Job Description] --> B;
    B --> D[NLP Skill & Entity Extractor];
    D --> E[Fallback NER Engine];
    D --> F[Skill Catalog Matching];
    E --> G[Data Aggregation];
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Pure-Python TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity];
    H --> I[Ranking & Scoring];
    I --> J[Matrix UI & Results Dashboard];
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Ingestion Engine**: The platform accepts multi-format resume artifacts (PDF/DOCX). It uses `pypdf` and `python-docx` for loss-less text extraction.
2.  **Semantic Extractor**: Our lightweight NLP pipeline identifies entities like `Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, and `Education`. It cross-references text against a pre-defined and custom skill catalog.
3.  **Vector Matcher**: Instead of simple keyword counting, it converts both the resume and the job description into numerical vectors.
4.  **Hybrid Scoring**: It calculates similarity using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and **Cosine Similarity**, weighted alongside direct keyword overlap to produce an accuracy percentage.
5.  **Intelligence Dashboard**: Results are streamed to a high-performance glassmorphism UI, featuring interactive charts (Chart.js) and a skill comparison matrix.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
